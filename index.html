        <h2>What is a User Story?</h2>
        <p>
          A user story is a record of a need, a single problem to be solved, or
          a simple statement that helps to capture the essence of what is
          required.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why User Stories?</h2>
        <p>
          User stories help to avoid losing the real problem, develop
          user-centric features, and assist in communicating and prioritizing
          tasks effectively.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Write a User Story?</h2>
        <p>
          For example: "As a small business owner, I want to control who has
          access to the various systems we use to operate."
        </p>
        <p>The three-part format:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As a &lt;some type of user&gt;</li>
          <li>I want to &lt;some need&gt;</li>
          <li>so that/because &lt;some reason&gt;</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What Not to Do</h2>
        <p>
          User stories are just the initial record of the need, not a "task" as
          such. Avoid technical suggestions or systems and do not jump to a
          solution.
